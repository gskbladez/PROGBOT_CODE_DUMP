__**Daemons**__ are the entities responsible for **DarkChips**. Mysterious beings with inestimatable powers, they prey on people's flaws to forge dark bonds with them.

Daemons have four aspects: their **Domain**, **Tribute**, **ChaosUnison**, and **Signature DarkChip**. Within their Domain, their powers are myriad and far-reaching: spawning Viruses, corrupting Mystery Data, and haunting NPCs are just some of the ways they can exert their influence. And while they are responsible for DarkChips, they can tempt Navis in other, crueler ways so long as it aligns with their Domain, all in exchange for a Bond Point or Tribute.

However, even if a Navi and/or NetOp have a Daemon Bond, that is not a sign that they are “evil.” Daemons are cruel beings that prey on people’s flaws. Daemon Bonds are a sign of unhealthy coping methods, not evil.

**Most of all, player comfort supersedes everything else.** Daemons deal with toxic/abusive relationships and power dynamics. Confirm everyone’s consent before bringing it into play, and if a player ends up disliking the arc, they can ultimately cut it out of the character's story. “Canon” is less important than everyone, players and GMs, enjoying the game.
