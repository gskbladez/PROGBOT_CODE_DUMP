__**Navi Power Upgrades**__ (NPUs) are NCPs that can be used to upgrade Navi Powers. All NPUs require the original Navi Power, either from character creation or a NaviCust Program. **You can only have one Navi Power Upgrade installed for each Navi Power**; you cannot get around the “one NPU per power” restriction by installing duplicate Navi Powers.
Benefits from Navi Power Upgrades are lost if either the Upgrade or the Navi Power itself are uninstalled. Anything that copies Navi Powers (e.g. NaviChips) also copies NPUs.
