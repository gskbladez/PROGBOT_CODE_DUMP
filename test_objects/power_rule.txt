All Navis have __**Navi Powers**__: special abilities they can use at any time. There are two types of powers:
- <:cost:> **Cost Powers** reduce the relevant skill by one to use them, no roll required. Cost Powers cannot be used if the skill is 0.
 > - <:roll:> **Roll Powers** roll the relevant skill to use the power.

Additionally, certain powers activate <:instant:> **Instantly** and can be used alongside other rolls, Powers, or chips, though they cannot be used to interrupt other's actions.
Targets can defend against Navi Powers that directly impede them (e.g. Disruption; not Analyze).
