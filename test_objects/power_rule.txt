All Navis have __**Navi Powers**__: special abilities they can use at any time. There are two types of powers:\n- <:cost:> **Cost Powers** reduce the relevant skill by one to use them, no roll required. Cost Powers cannot be used if the skill is 0.\n > - <:roll:> **Roll Powers** roll the relevant skill to use the power.\n\nAdditionally, certain powers activate <:instant:> **Instantly** and can be used alongside other rolls, Powers, or chips, though they cannot be used to interrupt other's actions.\nTargets can defend against Navi Powers that directly impede them (e.g. Disruption; not Analyze).\n\nIf you have questions about edge cases regarding a Navi Power, try `help power clarifications`!
