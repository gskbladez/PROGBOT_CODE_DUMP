LifeVirus	Life Virus	Nobody can hurt you. You are finally safe.	Fear, Security, Isolation	Vanish	The Navi temporarily disappears. Nobody knows where they go. When they return, they remember little to nothing about their disappearance, but are ice-cold to the touch.	Undying	The hands of the LifeVirus protect the Navi during CrossSoul, rising from the Navi’s back. When you would take damage from an enemy attack, the LifeVirus’s hands redirect the attack to a Near target of the LifeVirus’ choice. Anyone with a Bond with the Navi upshifts their roll to defend, and is pushed away a range band if they fail to defend.

Gospel		You were weak. You were pathetic. Then I found you.	Power, Impulse, Self-Destruction	BugCurse	The Navi's code corrupts. Daemon picks 2 bugs: they cannot feel or display emotion; they cannot speak or write; on failing a roll, they take -1 HP; anyone they touch gets a Bond with Gospel; their element is changed to Corruption; they cannot jack out when a known enemy is Near. When you increase your Daemon Bond, fix 1 bug.	BugCharge	During CrossSoul, the Navi's body is riddled with glowing, flickering spots. They are immune to their bugs. When the Navi rolls to damage anything, they add X dice, where X=the # of bugs affecting them.

Alpha		You don’t have to be different anymore.	Belonging, Uniformity, Purpose	AlphaSeed	Plants an AlphaSeed deep in the server. It gradually grows over time, leading Alpha to assimilate the server. As the seed grows, the server slows down, grows cold, and turns increasingly monochrome.	Assimilate	Alpha’s eye appears on the Navi during CrossSoul. They heal 2 HP every roll as Alpha's gelatinous membrane spreads out from the eye. Anyone that touches the membrane is infected with the AlphaBug. After the infection germinates, it either slowly deletes them before absorbing them into Alpha, or Alpha creates a Level 2 Bond with them.

Duo		We will achieve justice. They will pay for their crimes.	Law, Vengeance, Penance	Repent	Affixes a red gem to the Navi. If the Navi/NetOp knows of anyone breaking the law, the gem begins flashing. If the Navi/NetOp does not fully report the crime within a minute, all gems detonate. Damage to the Navi = 5x[Gem #]. Also hurts the PET; 3 total gem detonations will destroy it.	AngerImpact	During CrossSoul, the Navi gains Duo’s stomach cannon. When the Navi attacks targets Duo deems vile, the cannon glows; on hit, it fires a shockwave that adds 3 dice to the attack, knocks anyone defending the target back a range band, and destroys Near recording devices.

Nebula Gray	Nebula Grey, NebulaGray, NebulaGrey	You owe them nothing. Take what’s rightfully yours.	Exploitation, Greed, Cruelty	InvisibleHand	Nebula Gray's hand hovers nearby. Only the Navi can see it. Sooner or later, it marks something valuable (monetarily, culturally, emotionally, etc) with its claws. In due time, the object turns to dust. The hand then disappears. Roll Hard Bravery to temporarily ward the hand off.	ShockTherapy	During CrossSoul, the Navi is bathed in Nebula Gray's fire. The fire spreads to everything they target with a chip/roll/Navi Power. It doesn’t hurt the Navi. All who touch the fire reduce their Max HP by 1 for each roll/chip used while aflame. Permanently damages the environment.

Cache		You could have it all back, just like you remember it.	Nostalgia, Denial, Regret	Haunted	After time passes, the Navi will hear voices and see visions of past regrets. Cache controls them. They look/sound real, and may require a Hard Bravery roll to ignore. They only leave when the NetOp/Navi agree to sacrifice something that the visions demand.	Reversion	During CrossSoul, the Navi grows Cache's ringed horns. They gain the element Memories, which can return anything to how they remember, including creating life. Roll 3+[Daemon Bond] dice to summon and manipulate it. Cache controls any living being created by Reversion.	FlashMemory	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gskbladez/meddyexe/master/virusart/portraitcache.png	NetBattlers Advance
Gregar		The weak should fear the mighty. Which are you?	Pride, Volatility, Arrogance	Pressure	The next 3 times you fail a roll or take damage, the negative effects are transferred to the weakest Near ally as chosen by the Daemon.	BeastOut	During CrossSoul, the Navi grows Gregar's spiky mane. Set your Feral count to 0. Add 1 when you: damage or intimidate someone; use a DarkChip; reject assistance; escalate a scenario into violence; respond with no emotion other than rage; or destroy something harmless. When you do anything else and your Feral > 0, subract 1. Add Feral to Body rolls. Can spend 1 Feral to reroll an attack or extend your CrossSoul by 1 roll.	BeastOver	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gskbladez/meddyexe/master/virusart/portraitgregar.png	NetBattlers Advance
Falzar		They never loved you, but they will. I will fix you.	Ego, Love, Glamour	Decay	The Navi's appearance gradually decays, twisting and morphing into a repulsive imitation of their normal self. The only way to fix it is to either permanently reduce your Max HP by 1 or to choose a friendly character to pass it on to. Their symptoms will not be immediate.	RedCrest	Falzar's crimson wings rise from the Navi's back during CrossSoul. When the Navi takes a target down to 2 HP or less, they can make an Easy Charm or Bravery roll to give the target a command. The target must obey; their mind is under the Navi's spell.

Neko Virus	NekoVirus, CatVirus, LionMen, Lion Men, Neko, Cat	OwO	Mischief, Existential Anguish, Cat	Kittification	The infection inches deeper into the Navi's essence. Gain one power from the [Infection Path](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7MFxgCUy-2mCPpeyoH2tcihlUF5dECz/view) and describe how your body, demeanor, mannerisms, and mind change to become more catlike.	Catastrophe	The legion joins the Navi. The Navi gains 9 Chaos Tokens. The Navi can spend 1 token to summon someone under the control of the Neko Virus. They can choose a specific infected individual, or they can let the Neko Virus choose. Everyone summoned can follow a simple command (i.e. block the exit, glomp them, etc).	9Lives	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gskbladez/PROGBOT_CODE_DUMP/master/virusart/portraitneko.png	Neko Virus
