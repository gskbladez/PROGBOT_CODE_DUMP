Command	Alias	Type	Hidden?	Ruling?	Response
roll	r	Rollers	FALSE	rollhelp	__**Rolls**__ a number of X-sided dice, including success/fail thresholds or additional hits.
repeatroll	rr, repeatr	Rollers	FALSE	rollhelp	__**Repeats a roll**__ a number of times. Otherwise, uses the same dice algebra as `roll`.
rulebook		Lookups	FALSE		Pulls up links for the NetBattlers __**rulebooks**__.

difficulties	rolldifficulty, difficulty, upshift, upshifting, downshift, downshifting, easy, normal, hard, success, failure, mixedsuccess, partialsuccess, full, fail, failedroll, mixed, partial, crit, criticalsuccess, critsuccess	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		When characters try to overcome a challenge with an uncertain outcome, they __**roll**__ dice to see what happens. There are three levels of difficulty:\n- **Easy:** Dice that read **4, 5, 6** are hits. Failure is easy to avoid.\n- **Normal:** **5, 6** are hits. Success is not a guarantee.\n- **Hard:** Only **6** is a hit. Proficient characters may still struggle.\nRoll difficulties reflect the difficulty of the task at hand, irrespective of the character acting: for example, an Easy roll is Easy for everyone. Circumstances may make a roll harder or easier, called **upshifting** (increase difficulty) and downshifting (decrease difficulty) a roll respectively.\n**You only need to roll if it’s interesting. If it doesn’t matter, or if it’s obvious the character could clear the obstacle, don’t bother rolling.**\n\nTo roll, the player adds their skill and the related stat, then rolls that many dice. They then count the number of hits to see how well they did:\n- **0 Hits - Failure:** Something bad happens. This could mean the character fails to achieve their goal, or they accomplish it at a high cost, like a dangerous outcome that affects their allies too.\n- **1 Hit - Mixed Success:** Success with drawbacks, like new threats, lost resources, or bad luck. Expect tough choices.\n- **2 Hits - Full Success:** A success without complication.\n- **3+ Hits - Critical Success:** A stylish success with extra benefits.\n
stats	skills, stat, skill	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		All characters, ranging from Navis to Viruses, have **three stats** and **nine skills**, with each stat having three related skills.\n> **Mind:** Sense, Info, Coding\n> **Body:** Strength, Speed, Stamina\n> **Soul:** Charm, Bravery, Affinity\nWhen rolling skills, the player adds the skill and the related stat, then rolls that many dice. For more information on each skill, try using `help!` (i.e. `help speed`)\n\nWhen something lets you **roll one skill in place of another**, you roll the substitute skill with the replaced skill’s effects. It still counts as a roll for the substitute skill.\n\nSkills cannot be reduced below 0. Stats cannot be reduced below 1. You also cannot perform any action that would result in reducing a stat/skill below its minimum.\n**NetOps:** Skills cannot exceed 5. Stats cannot exceed 3.\n**Navis:** Skills cannot exceed 5. Stats cannot exceed 4.
sense		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Study your surroundings, find jack-in ports, and take aim!
info		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Possess knowledge and expertly wield Battle Chips!
coding		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Program, hack, and rewire things!
strength		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Lift, throw, and punch objects and people!
speed		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Run, jump, and roll!
stamina		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Endure pain and danger!
charm		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Sweet-talk, feign innocence, and gain allies!
bravery		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Resist fear, intimidate enemies, and inspire your allies!
affinity		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Manipulate your Navi element, and sync your NetOp and Navi!
pet		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Smartphones and PDAs have evolved into **PET**s (**PE**rsonal **T**erminal), handheld devices containing personal assistants known as NetNavis.\n\nNetOps carry their Navis with them in PETs. By plugging their PETs into ports on all kinds of electronics (called **jacking in**), NetOps can transport their Navis into cyberspace. While cyberspace and the real world are separate, they can affect each other. Nearly everything has a jack-in port if you look closely.
jackin	jack-in		FALSE		Nearly everything has a jack-in port if you look closely. When a NetOp jacks their Navi into immediate danger, the NetOp rolls **Affinity** to sychronize with the Navi.\n- **On a full success**, the Navi can act immediately.\n- **On a mixed success**, the Navi's data transmits with a brief delay.\n- **On a failure**, the Navi is vulnerable to attackers with barely any time to react.
jackout	jack-out		FALSE		When the Navi returns to the PET by jacking out, under normal circumstances, it returns to full health, all temporary effects (e.g. skill reductions) are removed, and all used BattleChips are returned to a usable condition. Jacking out under pressure also requires a **NetOp Affinity** roll.\n- **On a full success**, the Navi jacks out without complications.\n- **On a mixed success**, the Navi may take longer to jack out, or they may not have their health, skills, or BattleChips immediately returned to normal.\n- **On a failure**, at least one of those complications occurs, if not more.
navicust	navicustprograms, navicustprogram, ncps	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	ncpruling	The **__Navi Customizer__ (NaviCust)** is cutting-edge tech that modifies Navis using software called Navi Customizer Programs (NCPs). The NaviCust is the primary form of Navi progression. **Check with your GM to see how many EB (Exabytes) your character starts with!**
ncp		Lookups	FALSE	ncpruling	This command can display __**NCPs**__. It can also search by EB cost and Crossover Content.
goals	growingup, growup, levelup, levelingup	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		During character creation, every player writes **3 goals** for their character. Goals are simple statements, usually just a sentence, that describe how the player wants their character's story to evolve in the near future.\n\nCompleting your goals should always have a meaningful impact on everything involved, especially your character. The best goals are about relationships, character motivations, and personal growth. If you’re not sure whether you’ve completed a goal, ask yourself if pursuing this goal has meaningfully changed your character, the setting, or the plot; if so, you can probably mark it as complete.\n\nCompleting a goal normally takes multiple sessions. As long as every individual goal has a meaningful impact on the story, players are able to progress multiple goals at once. When you complete a goal, **write a new one and choose one skill to increase by 1**.\nIf one or more player characters played a critical role in helping you complete your goal, you can pick one and **increase your shared Bond Level by 1.**\n\nFor more information and advice on writing goals, see `help goalsadvice`!
goalsex	goalsextra, goalsadvice, levelupextra, levelingupextra, growingupextra, growupex, growupextra, goaladvice	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		When players write goals for their characters, they communicate with their GM to make sure the GM can integrate those goals into the story moving forward. (If a goal directly involves another player character, players should be sure to discuss how they feel about the goal.)\n\nTry to avoid goals that are just about increasing power or overly general, or aren't about a specific character.\n\nWhen writing a goal, refer to the three questions below — the more you can answer “yes” to, the better a goal it is.\n- **Does it make the world a more interesting place?**\n- **Does it give the character depth or growth?**\n- **Does it make the story more fun for everyone?**\n\nYou can change your goals between sessions. However, players should always be sure to talk with their GM about changing goals. The GM should be using the players’ goals to influence their sessions; not telling your GM when you change your goals can make it harder for them to help your character shine. \n\nKeep in mind, goals are what you want to happen with your character - it doesn't have to be what your character wants! Character growth can come from hard times, and it can be fun to put your character in a bad spot and see how they overcome it.
bond	bondpower, bondpowers	Lookups	FALSE	bondruling	This command displays __**Bond Powers**__, along with points needed and what they do. (Use `bond all` to see all of them!)
bondpoint	bondpoints, bonds	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	bondruling	
session0		Reminders (Base)	FALSE		__**Session Zero**__\nBefore your first session, hold a "Session Zero" where you and your players can talk about expectations, ideas, and desires. This is also a time to get everyone together for character creation, and to help create a party dynamic. The following are some important areas to hit on when playing NetBattlers - work together on each section!\n__**Tone**__\nEveryone should be clear on a campaign's tone. For example, if you're emulating the colorful and cartoony tone of the Battle Network games, edgy and grim player characters will feel out of place. Keeping everyone on the same page will help everyone feel like their character belong.\n\n__**Safety Tools**__\nSometimes, stories go to places people aren't ready for. Safety tools help people avoid and process discomfort. No safety tool is one-size-fits-all, but every table should use at least one. Some examples:\n- **Lines and Veils, by Ron Edwards**: Before play, everyone writes Lines (content that will not come up during play) and Veils (content that will happen "off-screen" and with little detail). Check in time to time to see if people have additions or changes.> - **The X-Card, by John Stavropoulos**: Before play, the GM puts a card with an X drawn on it on the table. Whenever someone is uncomfortable with something in play, they can tap or hold up the card, no explanation needed. It doesn't matter why. The story then continues, removing whatever was X-Carded. If there are any issues, players can take a break and talk privately. (Read the original, full text of the X-Card here: <http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg>) \n- **Breaks**: After long or intense sections, take a break to cool off, stay focused, and process everything that's happened so far. Before play resumes, check in to see how everyone's feeling.\n_For a breakdown of additional safety tools and commands built into ProgBot, refer to `help safetytools`._\n\nFor a continued explanation, refer to `help session0ex`.
session0ex		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Goals and Wishes**__\nAsk what everyone wants from the game. Some people love combat, while others just want character drama. Some want hard challenges, while others want the leeway to make bad choices. Catering to everyone's goals - yourself included - keeps the table engaged.\n\n__**Character Creation and Party Dynamic**__\nWhile creating characters on your own time can be more time efficient, spending part of Session Zero making characters together can help forge a good group dynamic from the get-go, avoiding first session awkwardness and getting players excited to play. Use the starting Bonds as a springboard for a greater conversation about how the different player characters get along.\n\n_Relationship Kickstarters_: Need help with your party dynamic? Take turns suggesting relationship types between characters. Keep them short and sweet, and let everyone suggest at least two. Here are some examples:\n- Best friends, but also rivals\n- Inseparable siblings\n- One used to bully the other\n- Mentor and mentee\n- One has a crush, the other is completely oblivious
					
hitpoints	hp, maxhp, deletion, delete, backup, ko, forcejackout	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		__**Hit Points**__, or **HP**, measure how fighting fit a character is. **Maximum HP starts at Body + Stamina + 5**. (When a character's Stamina or Body is temporarily changed, their HP is unaffected.)\n\nSpending your own HP to activate an effect **does not** count as taking damage, and it does not allow a defense roll.\n\nWhen a human's HP hits zero, they pass out. When a Navi hits zero HP, the attacker picks if they're KO'd, forcibly jacked out, or deleted.\n\n**Deletion** can mean different things depending on the tone of the story, ranging from permanent death, to the inconvenience of getting backup data. Everyone at the table should feel comfortable with deletion's repercussions, including getting a say about if/when their Navi faces deletion.
rangebands	rangeband, range, distance, close, near, far	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		There are three **range bands** used to measure distance between targets: **Close**, **Near**, and **Far**.\n\n- **Close**: Arm's reach. Melee attacks can only land in Close range.\n- **Near**: Speaking distance. Ranged attacks land normally when Near.\n- **Far**: Shouting distance. Ranged attacks are upshifted at Far range.\n\n**An item or power's listed range** is usually the maximum range, and can still be used against those in a closer range band.  **Skills/Powers without clear range limitations** can work at any range, though longer ranges often make them more difficult, especially when trying to do things quickly and/or accurately.\n\nMoving a range band only requires a Speed roll if it's especially dangerous and/or time-sensitive. Some effects directly prevent a target from moving range bands; however, this does not prevent others from moving them. 
charge		Reminders (Base)	FALSE		When you roll hits that have no narrative consequence, convert the extra hits to **Charge**. Each Navi can store up to **3 Charge** at a time.\n\nExamples of scenarios that can grant Charge include:\n- Attacks (rolled or chips) whose damage exceeds the target’s HP. (1 Charge per extra point of damage.)\n- Defense rolls that exceed the attack’s damage. (1 Charge per extra hit.)\n- Non-combat opposed rolls where one side wins by 2+ hits\n- Critical successes, especially with 4+ hits. (Whether to grant a narrative benefit or Charge is always up to the Game Master.)\n\nImmediately after a Navi rolls, they can `spend X Charge` to increase the result of a die by `1`, `X times`. When a Navi **assists** another Navi’s roll, in addition to potentially downshifting the roll, they can spend Charge for that roll. **NetOps** can also spend Charge if their player explains how their Navi is assisting them.\n\nUnlike most things, Charge **does not** reset immediately upon jacking out. It gradually reduces over time, draining from full to empty over a **few hours** outside of high-tension scenarios.
parry	parries, parrying, parrythisyoufuckingcasual	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		A character can try to resist a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a __**parry**__. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled. (Note: parries are affected by anything that modifies **either attacking or defending**.)\n\nIf the two characters **tie**, they have a choice: **back out** or **escalate**. Both parties should declare this simultaneously.\n- If **both back out**, nobody takes damage and the parry ends.\n- If **one escalates and the other backs out**, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser.\n- If **both parties escalate**, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser **takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack**. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up. Secondary effects (e.g. stunning) do not activate until after the parry resolves.\n\nFor parrying edge cases and clarifications, try `help parry ex`!
flow	actionflow, gameflow, flowofaction	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Action Flowchart**__\n> **1.** The GM makes the scene's Spotlight Checklist\n> **2.** The GM details the scene\n> **3.** The GM asks who wants to go first (or picks a player)\n> **4.** Two/three threats progress\n> **5.** The spotlight player acts\n> **6.** Mark the spotlight player off the Spotlight Checklist. If every player is marked off, the checklist refreshes\n> **7.** The spotlight player picks who goes next\n> **8.** Return to Step 4.\n\nKeep scenes fast and cinematic! Don't worry about exactly where or how far away everything is. It's way more important to stay creative and have fun describing your Navi leaping through the air and blasting a Virus with an earth-shaking KABOOM!\n\nFor information on the **Spotlight Checklist**, see `help spotlight`!\nFor information on the **Threat Progression** model, see `help threats`!
spotlight	spot, checklist	Helpers	FALSE	spotlightruling	This command starts a __**Spotlight Checklist**__ that you can update with commands.
spotlightchecklist		Reminders (Base)	TRUE	spotlightruling	
spotlightex	spotlightexplanation, interrupt	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		There are situations in which player actions do not mark them off the **Spotlight Checklist**:\n- **Being acted upon** by an outside force (e.g. rolling to defend) does not advance the Spotlight Checklist.\n- The few effects that allow players to **act immediately** (e.g. the Support BattleChip called Reflex) do not advance the Spotlight Checklist either.\n\nGMs may encounter players that want to hop in on other players' Spotlight turns to assist them. While players **cannot circumvent** the Spotlight Checklist, they can instead spend their time in the spotlight **preparing narrative assets** to assist their allies. (e.g. tossing a critical item to whichever player comes next; prepping a lightshow to dazzle the opposition.) GMs should encourage players to set up resources for their allies so, when players outside the spotlight want to help, they can point to things already in the scene instead of inadvertently trying to steal the spotlight.
threats	threat, threatprogression, ready, aim, fire, raf	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		As the **Spotlight Checklist** progresses, enemies, hazards, and other threats will also act. When a new player takes the spotlight, before they act, the GM describes how two or three threats progress with **Ready**, **Aim**, and **Fire**.\n\n- **A threat is __Ready__** when the GM has clearly introduced it into the scene. GMs can introduce new threats into the scene at the start of a player's turn by describing its entrance, making it Ready. Threats only need to be **Ready** once.\n- **A threat is __Aimed__** when it foreshadows an action it's about to take. When a GM makes a threat **Aim**, players should know it's immediately important, even if the exact details are obscured. Threats **cannot Aim** if they are not Ready. Players **can interrupt** Aimed threats to set them back to Ready, though for Viruses and other animate threats, *simply taking damage is not enough to interrupt an attack*.\n- **A threat is __Fired__** when it acts, interrupting the player's spotlight to directly threaten one or more players. If a _Virus_ Aims to attack a player, when it Fires, it makes the attack roll. If an _environmental hazard_ Fires, it forces the targeted player to immediately react on the defensive. Threats **cannot Fire** until they **Aim**. After Firing, threats are no longer Aimed.\n\nA single threat cannot progress multiple times in the same player turn. When players are forced to roll due to threats Firing, it does not mark them off the Spotlight Checklist.\nOccasionally, a single character can create multiple threats. However, even in these cases, the GM should try to differentiate how the character is preparing the threats. (e.g. the big villain is charging up their shoulder-mounted cannons as they throw a chunk of scenery at a player.)\n\nWhen the action ends, the GM can stop using the Spotlight Checklist.\n_Remember: Readying and Aiming a threat doesn't mean you need to show all your cards!_
chip	chips	Lookups	FALSE	chipruling	This command can display info on __**BattleChips**__. It can also search for all BattleChips from a specific category, with a specific tag, Crossover Content source, or in a specific license.
battlechip	battlechips	Reminders (Base)	TRUE	chipruling	
effects	secondaryfx, stacking, effect, sfx, effectstacking, secondaryeffects, temporaryeffects, temporaryeffect, buff, debuff, buffs, debuffs	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Some attacks have temporary **secondary effects** in addition to damage, such as stunning or moving the target. When defending, **rolling equal to the attack's damage** will still trigger the effect, even though all damage was resisted. The defender must **roll an extra hit to resist the full attack**, effect included. Rolling just enough hits to resist the full attack counts as a tie.\n\n__**Additional Rulings**__\n- If effects have **different sources**, they can stack. Otherwise, only one instance of the effect can affect the target at once. (Effects are considered identical based on their source, with "source" referring to the specific Navi Power/BattleChip/etc that created the effect.)\n- Activating an effect with a limited duration **while the effect is already active** refreshes its duration.\n- **Roll-based durations** include defense rolls. Rerolls do not decrease roll-based durations. (Defense against multi-hit attacks also only count as one roll.)\n- When **spending** skills or stats to activate effects, **drain temporary bonuses** first.\n- Stat/skill bonuses from **outside sources** do not update to reflect changes to the outside source. Likewise, changing stat/skill bonuses from an outside source does not copy those changes onto the source.
multihit	multi-hit	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Some attacks hit multiple times, and are called __**multi-hit**__ attacks. Multi-hit attacks are written as [hit damage]x[number of hits]. (For example, if something is written as "1x4 damage", that means it deals 1 damage 4 times.) When defending against a multi-hit attack, the defender rolls once and uses that value to defend against each hit. \n\n__**Additional Rulings**__\n- **Guard chips** block each hit of a multi-hit attack separately.\n- Defending against a multi-hit attack only decreases **roll-based durations** once.\n- When **parrying** a multi-hit attack, one hit lands each parry round. If the multi-hit user wins, any hits left land too; if they lose (or tie or back off), remaining hits don't trigger; if they tie and escalate, the next round uses the attack's next hit, if any remain.
target	targeting, targetingterms, someone, something, ally, enemy, targets, allies, enemies	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Targeting Terms**__\nWhen chips, NCPs, and such describe what they can affect, they use these terms:\n- **Target:** Anything but you.\n- **Someone:** Any living being.\n- **Object:** An inanimate thing.\n- **Ally:** Anyone alive you're cooperating with.\n- **Enemy:** Anyone alive you're directly opposing.\n_Note:_ Only Navis & Viruses can count as allies or enemies.\n
folder	chipfolder, battlechipfolder	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		A Navi's __**Folder**__ is the list of pre-selected chips they can use. You can only modify your Folder when jacked out.\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi Info + 5**. By default, **Folders may not have duplicate BattleChips or more than 1 MegaChip**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nWhen you jack in, you can use chips in your Folder in any order. You can use each chip once before jacking out. When you jack out, all chips are refreshed for use next time you jack in. Chips outside of your Folder are unusable. If you acquire a BattleChip while jacked in, you can only add it to your Folder if your Folder is not full.
tag		Lookups	FALSE		This command pulls up the description for a __**Tag**__ or __**Category**__.\n\nViruses and Battlechips have **Tags** and **Categories** that determine how they behave or work in battle. For a list of them, try `chip tags` / `chip categories` and `virus tags`/`virus categories`!
download	virusdownload, chipdata	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		After deleting a Virus, a Navi can try to capture its attack data. The difficulty depends on the following criteria:\n- The Navi began to process the Virus immediately after deletion.\n- The Virus was deleted quickly.\n- The Virus did minimal damage.\nIf none are true, there will not be enough data to piece together anything usable.\n\nFor **__NetOp/Navi pairs__**, the Navi may attempt to send data to a Blank BattleChip by rolling **Navi Coding**. If all 3 criteria are met, the roll is Easy; if 2, Normal; and only 1, Hard. Outside circumstances may make the roll more difficult (e.g. trying to write to a Blank BattleChip while in active combat.)\n\n- On a **mixed success**, the BattleChip may not be the data you were looking for (Zenny, a different BattleChip, useful info). \n- On a **full success**, the Blank BattleChip contains a chip listed on the Virus's drops. \n- On a **critical success**, the Navi may choose which of the Virus's chips to receive, and/or get extra data with the BattleChip, immediately usable. \n- On a **failure**, treat as a mixed success, but something bad happens...\n\nFor ** __Independent Navis__** don’t roll to download Virus attack data. Instead, they **always get a chip on deletion**, with the number of uses equal to the number of difficulty critera met.\n\nDownloaded data from **Equipped** Viruses includes the equipped chip on success (and include a tell, too!).
finaleroll	finale	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		If one side has the upper hand and the conflict's reached a forgone conclusion, it's time for a **__Finale Roll__**! The winner outlines the **outcome** they want, while the loser presents a **complication**. Then, everyone makes one final action and sums the **Hits**; the side with the most Hits wins and has their outcome/complication happen! *(Difficulty depends on how well-suited the roll is for the outcome. Ties go to the upper hand.)*\n- **Cost Powers** and **Chips** add 1-3 Hits, depending on how well-suited for the situation they are. Light **Hazards** add 2 Hits, Normal add 4, and Extreme add 6!\n- **Viruses** independently choose to **Fight** (Bravery, attack) or **Flight** (Bravery, Speed, escape), then sum all their hits!  If they win:\n  - Those who Fight deal their total damage to one target (downshift to let the losers distribute damage)\n  - Those who Flight usually have a plan or goal for after! (Downshift to drop your data on the way.)
					
netop	kid, kidstats, kids, kidstat, kidnetop, kidnetops, netopstats, netops, child, childstats, childstat	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__NetOps__** are real-world people that use Navis.\n**__Kid__** NetOp **stats** start at 2 by default. Choose one stat and set it to 1.\nNetOp **skills** start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set them to 2.\nMaximum **HP** starts at **Body + Stamina + 5**.\nNetOps also start off with **one Talent**. Use `help talent` for more details!\n\nBy default, NetOps start with **4 starter BattleChips**. Try `chip starter` for a list!
talents	talent	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		NetOps have __**Talents**__: one for Kids, two for Teens, and three for Adults. Talents can be any area of expertise or interest. They should be general enough that they could organically come up (e.g. “Theater,” not “Ancient Opera”), but not so general that they apply more often than they don’t (e.g. “Judo,” not “Fighting”).\n**Once per session**, a NetOp can turn a failure/mixed success into a full success if it falls under their Talent. **__This only applies to NetOp rolls.__**
navi	navis, navistats, navistat, naviskills, naviskill, startingstats	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Short for Internet Navigator, __**Navis**__ are digital people capable of manipulating electronic devices.\nNavis set one **stat** to 1, one to 2, and one to 3.\nNavi **skills** start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two skills and set them to 2. Set another skill to 3.\nMaximum **HP** starts at **Body + Stamina + 5**. **Folder Size** starts at **Info + 5**. \nWhen creating a Navi, choose any **three Navi Powers**. You can use `help powers` for more details.\nFinally, pick an **element** for your Navi. Use `help element` for more guidance on how to pick your element.
element		Rollers	FALSE	elementruling	This command rolls random __**elements**__ from the Element Generation table. Type `element` for more details.
power	powers	Lookups	FALSE	powerruling	This command can display Navi and Virus __**Powers**__. It can also search powers by type, such as Navi Sense/Cost and Virus Passive. Type `power` to learn more!
					
prog	progs	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Us __**Progs**__ are peppy little workers that keep the world’s computers running. We're designed for all kinds of purposes, with most everyday things containing multiple Progs. A single vending machine could have half a dozen Progs inside — it’s a lot of work to manage inventory, perform maintenance, and say "thank you for your purchase!"\n\nDue to our one-track minds, Progs are often naive and oblivious. However, they’re still individuals with their own quirks — and often their own **hats**!
servers	server, console, consoles, controlpanel, controlpanels, panel, panels	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Most computers primarily exist to manage real-world objects. In the digital space, they have **control panels** - often hidden, guarded with force, and/or unable to access without authorization. In the real world, systems have **exterior consoles**, with restricted physical access and login credentials. Consoles can show the server from different angles, can manipulate the server layout, and/or enable/disable features inside.
mirrordata	mirror, mirrors	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**Mirror Data** is data linked to a real-world equivalent that often (but not always!) looks exactly like its real-world counterpart. Sometimes it's there to make controlling the counterparts easier, while other times it's an inadvertent byproduct of the server's structure. It's usually **two-way**; by searching for objects linked to Mirror Data, NetOps can indirectly assist their Navis (and vice-versa).
link	links	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**Links** are a simple way to cut down on travel time on the internet, teleporting Navis from one end to the other. Some are **one-way**, **password**-protected, or even linked **between servers**. They’re used by practically everyone: best friends link each others’ homepages, like-minded enthusiasts forge webs of mutual links called “WebRings,” and huge corporate servers link their different areas for ease of maintenance.
					
zenny	money, currency, kromer, economy, shop, shops, shopprices, cash, cachemoney	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**Zenny** is the global currency in 200X, and there are many ways for players to acquire new items over the course of a campaign. This includes shops, exploration, and achieving milestones.\n\n__**Economy**__\nAs a general rule of thumb, Zenny is a common reward found throughout the adventures of the players. \n- **500z** is a good starting point for a small prize, like rewarding a player for snooping in a cupboard or in the change return of a vending machine.\n- Between **1000-2000z** is a moderate sum, useful for rewarding side missions or stylish Virus busting. \n- From **2000z** to **4000z** is a large reward; players should have to work for these, maybe sacrificing something or excelling as a team. \n- Anything above **4000z** is a jackpot prize; especially powerful items tend to be priced in this range, so dole these out rarely, and with good reason.\n\n__**Shop Prices**__\nItem prices in shops are contextual. When pricing items, think ahead to the challenges your players will face, and what will seem easy and difficult to make use of.\n- **500z - Basic or Situational**: These items aren't expected to be too useful - at least, not without a hefty dose of creativity. _Examples: Starter Chips, Hazard chips with harmless effects (e.g. sand), 1 EB NaviCust programs._\n- **1000z-2000z - Most Items**: These items are expected to be useful in general, or extremely useful in specific scenarios. _Examples: 2EB NCPs, 2-3DMG chips, an item that helps for the upcoming challenge_\n- **3000z+ - Best of the Best**: These will be really useful for what's coming up next! _Examples: 4DMG chips, 4+EB NCPs, an item that exploits the boss's weakness_
hazard	hazards	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Hazards__** are environmental challenges that players might encounter, such as stepping across burning coals, breathing in clouds of poison gas, or being crushed by a boulder. GMs can reduce a Hazard's effects in exchange for another negative effect (e.g. upshifting rolls, setting off an alarm, briefly freezing a Navi in place). Players may suggest alternate ways of resisting hazards (e.g. Speed instead of Stamina). Lastly, normal upshifting/downshifting rules apply; some Hazards may be Easy to defend by default, or naturally Hard to resist. **Treat these hazard descriptions as flexible suggestions.**\n\nFor a list of hazard examples from the rulebook, type `help hazardex`!\nFor the ruling on player-made hazards, type `help playerhazard`!
hazardex	hazardexample, hazardexamples,  hazardsexamples, hazardsex	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		**Hazard Examples:**\n\n**Light hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 2 damage. On a mixed success, take 1.\n**Normal hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 4 damage. On a mixed success, take 2.\n**Extreme hazards:** Perform a Normal Stamina roll. On a failure, take 6 damage. On a mixed, take 4. On a full success, take 2. On a critical success, take 0.\n\n**Distractions:** Perform an Easy Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two Mind rolls. On a mixed success, upshift the next Mind roll. On a full success, nothing happens. Penalties will fade if you take time to rest and recollect yourself.\n**Panics:** Perform a Normal Bravery roll. On a failure, upshift the next two rolls. On a mixed success, upshift the next roll. On a full success, nothing happens. Penalties will fade if you get away from the source of the panic, take time to rest, and recollect yourself. Players can snap each other out of panics - doing so instantly could be the bonus effect of a critical success.\n**Freezes:** Perform a Hard Bravery roll. On a failure, you freeze for several seconds, too panicked to act. On a mixed success, you hesitate for just a moment. On a full success, nothing happens.
playerhazard	playermadehazards, playerhazards, pmh	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		Player elements are sometimes able to make hazards, and dangerous elements should come with matching limitations. Avoid allowing players to generate Extreme hazards from their element; it's hard to set balancing limitations that don't make it too deadly or too frustrating.\n\nOther tools can also create hazards. Chips like LavaSeed can be deadly; accordingly, GMs should be sure to play up their limitations, such as slow activation time or potential collateral damage.
					
virus		Lookups	FALSE	virusruling	This command can pull up a basic __**Virus**__ description.
virusx		Lookups	FALSE		This command pulls up the __**full statblock for Viruses**__, including stats, powers names, and drops. __This command is more for GMs rather than players in a session.__ 
virusr	virusrandom	Rollers	FALSE		Rolls __**random Viruses**__. You can also give me specific categories to roll Viruses from; check out `virusr` for more details!\nIf you're looking to lookup virus information, use `virus` or `virusx` instead.

mysteryreward		Rollers	FALSE		This command rolls __**Mystery Data (BattleChips and NCPs only)**__ and gives you the result automatically! Specify `mysteryreward common`, `mysteryreward uncommon`, or `mysteryreward rare`. You can also roll for rewards from different Mystery Data from NetBattlers Advance.
adventure		Rollers	FALSE		Rolls a randomly-generated __**adventure**__! Use `adventure core` to roll from the tables in the book, or `adventure chaos` for extra bonus scenarios! (Note: Still in development!)
fight		Rollers	FALSE		Rolls a randomly-generated boss __**fight**__ scenario!
					
navichip	navichips	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__NaviChips__** are **MegaChips** that store attack data from Navis, containing a small fragment of the Navi’s core data. When using a NaviChip, a temporary image of the Navi may emerge to perform a set action.\n\nNaviChips can be downloaded from two sources: **deleted Navis** or **close Bonds**.\nDeleted Navis, especially after a highly intense, dramatic combat, may have their data linger just long enough to capture their attack data into a Blank BattleChip. The first Navi to download the data receives the NaviChip — no roll necessary. It will be available for use after jack-out.\n\nWhen two characters (Navis or NetOps, player character or NPC) develop a close bond and have a capstone scene, the emotional energy can be harnessed by the Navis to create a **single NaviChip with both their data**. (A Navi can still participate in creating a capstone scene NaviChip if they did not participate in the scene but their NetOp did!)\n\nFor more details on capstone scenes, try `help capstone`! For the full ruleset on how GMs create NaviChips, check out the "**NaviChips**" section in the NetBattlers rulebook!
capstone	capstonescene	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		Once two characters, Navis or NetOps, develop a close bond, they can have a __**capstone scene**__ — an important, emotional scene that crystalizes the connection between the two characters. They can either happen between a player character and an NPC or between two PCs with **Bond Level 3**.\n\nCapstone scenes have three requirements:\n- **A meaningful interaction**, prepared by at least one PC involved, that demonstrates how far the relationship has developed.\n- **A location to meet** that everyone involved collaborates to choose and describe — preferably one private, quiet, and meaningful.\n- **Enough time** to express their feelings with little interruption.\n\nThe scene itself is up to the players, and should be communicated to both the GM and involved players ahead of time. Once the requirements are met and everyone is in agreement, the scene can begin. If it goes well, the Navis can harness the emotional energy to **create a single NaviChip with both their data**! (They do not have to participate in the scene to still create a capstone scene NaviChip.)
independent	indies, independentnavis, indienavis, independents, indie	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		__**Independent Navis**__ are Navis that function alone, with no NetOp to assist them.\n\nAs they are always online and never jack out, they can **rest for a few hours** to **restore their HP, spent skills/stats, and reconfigure their NaviCust.** While resting, Navis are completely inert. If a Navi is forced to act immediately after resting, they upshift their first three rolls.\n\nInstead of preparing Folders and slotting chips in, Independent Navis carry chip uses in their Folder at all times. Normal chips range from 0 to 3 uses; MegaChips max out at 1 use. They cannot hold more chips than their Folder size. Using a chip decrements the remaining number of uses; zero-use chips are unusable but still take Folder space, and disappear when removed from a Folder. **Independent Navis get a number of starting chips equal to their Folder size, each with two uses.**\n\n**Independent Navis have their own version of the Goals system**. Instead of earning skill points, they get +2 EB. They also use the Bond system, though FullSynchro is unusable. \n\nFor more details on **Advanced Rulings** for Independent Navis, use `help independent adv`! If you're not sure how a chip or NCP translates to Independent Navis, try checking those rules!
independentadv	indieadv, indiesadv, indieadvanced, indiesadvanced, indienaviadv, indienavisadv, indienaviadvanced, indienavisadvanced, independentadvanced, independentsadv, independentsadvanced, independentnaviadv, independentnavisadv, independentnaviadvanced, independentnavisadvanced	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		For **__Independent Navis__**, anything that requires sacrificing a **chip** sacrifices a charge instead. Anything that counts used chips in a Folder only counts zero-use chips. Any **NCP** that activates on jack-in instead activates after rest or drawing on a Hotspot. \n\nAnything that disrupts the link between Navi and **PET** instead jams their Folder; if something otherwise affects or depends on the PET, it instead affects/depends on the last used Hotspot. \n\nLastly, two Navi Power change for Independent Navis: **Reconfig** instantly trades BattleChips with a Near ally, and **Refresh** adds +2 to the user’s Folder size until rest. You can query them with ProgBot using `power ReconfigIndie` and `power RefreshIndie`.
hotspot	hotspots	Reminders (Base)	FALSE		**__Hotspots__** are landmarks containing power, ranging from symbolic statues to mysterious effigies and glowing fissures. All Hotspots have a **power rating** from 3 to 9. Hotspots also have an element relating to their origin or meaning, similar to Navis.\n\nNavis can draw upon Hotspots by making physical contact for a minute. Afterwards, they can reduce the Hotspot’s power rating by one to pick an effect:\n- Restore all missing HP and stat/skill points.\n- Set a BattleChip's uses to 3 (MegaChips incompatible).\n- Get +3 EB (expires next rest/Hotspot use) & reconfig your NCPs.\n- Raise a stat under 3 to 3. Expires next rest/Hotspot use.\n- Gain the Hotspot's element until next rest/Hotspot use.\n\nAfter a Hotspot’s power is reduced, it may take days or weeks to recover. Increasing a Hotspot’s power rating requires a high concentration of complex expressive data in its vicinity - in other words, strong expressions of emotion. That could manifest as an art festival, music concert, or dramatic battle. The more Navis, energy, and strong emotions are involved, the more power is added.
					
teen	teens, teen, teenstat, teenstats, teennetop, teennetops	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		**__Teen__** NetOps **stats** start at 2, except for one at 1.\nTeen **skills** start at 0 by default. Choose three skills and set them to 1. Choose one skill to set at 2, and one to set at 3.\nMaximum **HP** starts at **Body + Stamina + 5**.\nTeens also have **two Talents**. Use `help talent` for more details!\n\nBy default, NetOps start with **4 starter BattleChips**, not including any personal chips. Try `chip starter` for a list, or `chip c-license` if you're using License rules!
adult	adult, adults, adultstat, adultstats, adultnetop, adultnetops	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		**__Adult__** NetOps set one **stat** to 1, one to 2, and one to 3.\nAdult **skills** start at 0 by default. Choose two skills and set them to 1. Choose two other skills and set at 2.\nMaximum **HP** starts at **Body + Stamina + 5**.\nAdults also have **three Talents**. Use `help talent` for more details!\n\nBy default, NetOps start with **4 starter BattleChips**, not including any personal chips. Try `chip starter` for a list, or `chip c-license` if you're using License rules!
license	s-license, b-license, c-license, a-license, licenses	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		Experienced NetBattlers can start off with **__NetBattling Licenses__**, indicating their level of experience and power. There are three License ranks in the book: **C**, **A**, and **S-License**.\n\n **C-License:** *Experienced NetBattlers - best in the city*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **6EB** of space. You can have **one** Personal BattleChip. Pick from the base and C-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 4EB worth of NCPs to start out with.\n\n**A-License:** *Top-Tier NetBattlers - best in the nation*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **10EB** of space. You can have **two** Personal BattleChips. Pick from the base, C-License, and A-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 6EB worth of NCPs to start out with.\n\n**S-License:** *Legendary NetBattlers - best in the world*\n> Start with a NaviCust and **15EB** of space. You can have **three** Personal BattleChips. Pick from the base, C-License, A-License, and S-License pools for your starting chips, as well as 10EB worth of NCPs to start out with.\n\nFor more details on personal chips, try `help personal chips`.
personalchips	personalchip, personalbattlechips, personalbattlechip	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		When creating new characters, especially if they are starting off with Licenses, GMs may allow NetOps to get __**Personal BattleChips**__ when choosing starting chips.\n\nWhen the player chooses a Personal BattleChip, they pick any normal BattleChip that fits thematically with their NetOp/Navi, including whatever Crossover Content the GM allows. (i.e. PaladinSword for a medieval-style Navi, or Timpani for a drummer NetOp.) **The GM always gets the final say as to whether a BattleChip can be taken as a Personal BattleChip. **Personal Battlechips **do not** count towards the normal starting chip limit.
					
liberation	alarm, liberationmission, lock, libmission, locks, liberationmissions, libmissions	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		During __**Liberation Missions**__, tile entrances are armed with a sensor field to detect intruders. When a player enters the field, the **__alarm__** is triggered, though they may be able to bypass the sensors using Sneakrun or a chip like Invis or Shadow. Players are unable to bring their element from a prior room; the sensor field dissipates the element.\n\n**Each alarmed tile has an alarm control panel.** If the room is cleared of threats (no remaining hostile Viruses and hazards neutralized), the alarm deactivates automatically. Some rooms may allow players to leave the room before the alarm deactivates; in that case, the alarm will not sound if everyone leaves the room, but it will not count as deactivated and will reactivate the next time the players enter.\n\nAlarms have **Countdowns** before they activate. Type `help countdown` for more details.\n\nThe base types of locks are **Lockboxes**, **CryptoLocks**, **ProgLocks**, **SyncLocks**, and **StealthLocks**. Type `help [lock]` (i.e. `help lockbox`) for more details.
countdown	countdowns	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		There is a brief period between the alarm being triggered and its activation called the __**Countdown**__. During the Countdown, the GM gives the players a timer number, with lower numbers being more severe.\n\nEvery time a player **rolls** or uses a **Cost Power** or **BattleChip**, the Countdown timer lowers by 1. (Simple chips and Instant Powers do not decrease the timer.) Parrying and defending against an attack does not lower the Countdown timer.\n\n When the timer hits 0, the alarm sounds, which triggers one or more repercussions.
perfectliberation	perfectlib	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		If the tile is cleared with each player reducing the Countdown timer by one or less, the players get a __**Perfect Liberation**__.\nAfter the mission is complete, the GM may give the players a reward based on the number of Perfect Liberations they achieved.
lockbox	lockboxes	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Lockboxes**__ are encased in a hard shell that requires force to break. Once the shell is gone, anyone can disable it by pressing the buttons.
cryptolock	cryptolocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**CryptoLocks**__ are encrypted, unlocked by a **Normal Coding** roll.
proglock	proglocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**ProgLocks**__ are special blue-colored Mr. Progs. These Progs are able to turn the alarm on and off, but they tend to have personality quirks, and are often oblivious to threats facing the system. ProgLocks can often be deactivated by charming them or helping them with a small task, though intimidation may also work. Deleting a ProgLock automatically activates the alarm and makes it impossible to disable.
synclock	synclocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**SyncLocks**__ are made to ensure only human-controlled Navis pass. On activation, a series of prompts appears on the NetOp’s PET. The NetOp must succeed an **Easy Affinity** roll to sync up with their Navi and clear the prompts together. (Unusable by Independent Navis.)
stealthlock	stealthlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**StealthLocks**__ are invisible control panels. They emit a subtle audio signal (e.g. beeping; static) and can be found with a **Sense** roll, though noisy environments make that Hard. StealthLocks throw a shower of sparks when damaged, briefly revealing their position.
generator	generators	Reminders (Liberation)	FALSE		Liberation maps may have **__Generator__** tiles. Generators create extra difficulties for nearby tiles while they’re active, and are usually tightly guarded. Generators double as the alarm control for their tiles.\n\nPlayers will have to sabotage the generator to disable them; exactly how is up to the GM. Some generators can be hacked before being disabled for a one-time benefit.\n\nFor help on specific generators, try asking for it specifically! (i.e. `help amplifier`)
amplifier	amplifiers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Amplifiers**__ are bulky machines that temporarily power up Viruses within two tiles. First, the Viruses start beeping. Next, they swell with energy, getting +2 dice to their next roll.\nWhen hacking an Amplifier, for each hit, everyone gets that many bonus dice on their next roll.
spawner	spawners	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Spawners__** are glowing platforms that generate specific Viruses. When players clear a tile, the Spawner creates a Virus on a Spawner-adjacent tile. Spawners can only add one Virus per tile. If all adjacent tiles have a generated Virus, the Spawner expands its range by one.\nOn hacking a Spawner, it makes a friendly Virus to help the players.
shaker	shakers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**Shakers**__ are huge pistons that periodically sound a siren, then slam into the ground, sending massive shockwaves to nearby tiles. The GM decides the Shaker’s range. Anyone on the ground while the shockwaves rock nearby tiles upshifts their next roll. Shakers may also make the environment gradually more dangerous with their shattering quakes.\nOn successfully hacking a Shaker, at any point, the Navi can trigger a single remote earthquake in the tile they’re in.
scanner	scanners	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Scanners__** are giant radars that beep, then scan nearby tiles. The GM decides their range and if their view moves clockwise or counterclockwise. When the Scanner sweeps over a tile with players, any player caught moving reduces the Countdown by 2. The sweep lasts a few moments.\nWhen hacking a Scanner, the Navi can pick a contested tile. For each hit, the player can ask the GM about the tile’s: Viruses, hazards, alarm type, or threat.
jammer	jammers	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		**__Jammers__** are radio towers that enhance adjacent tiles’ alarms. In addition to the alarm’s normal effects, the Jammer fills the tile with PET-jamming signals, blocking chip usage and communication between NetOps and Navis until the alarm is deactivated.
					
audience	audienceparticipation	Rollers	FALSE	audienceruling	This command lets you query the Cheer/Jeer tables from the __**Audience Participation**__ rules and roll random Cheer/Jeer effects! (You can also use `cheer` and `jeer` as shortcuts.) Type `audience help` for more details!
cheer		Rollers	FALSE	cheerruling	This command lets you query the __**Cheer**__ tables and roll random Cheer effects! Type `cheer help` for more details!
jeer		Rollers	FALSE	jeerruling	This command lets you query the __**Jeer**__ tables and roll random Jeer effects! Type `jeer help` for more details!
goallock	goallocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**GoalLocks**__ look like sports goals, labelled to show who owns them. They give the owner a point when something specific is put inside (e.g. a ball; a Mettaur; a cake.) If a room has only one GoalLock, it gives a point to whoever makes the goal. When the alarm triggers, the team with the most points wins.
teamlock	teamlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**TeamLocks**__ look like pressure plates, buttons, and other simple devices. TeamLocks only appear in team matches. If teams have X number of players, a tile has X number of TeamLocks. All of them must be activated simultaneously by Close Navis in order to work. The first team to work the TeamLock wins.
crownlock	crownlocks	Reminders (Liberation)	TRUE		__**CrownLocks**__ look like large, fancy headware. Once a Navi puts it on, it shines bright. When the Navi would cause the tile’s Countdown to lower by 1, they instead gain a point. Removing the crown does not reset points. When a Navi reaches 3 points, the CrownLock activates and the Navi wins.
					
daemon		Lookups	FALSE	daemonruling	This command looks up a **Daemon's** information for DarkChip rules. For additional details on DarkChip rules (i.e. DarkChip limits, Tributes, ChaosUnisons, and Daemon Bonds), try checking `help` (i.e. `help darkchips`).
darkchip	darkchips, signaturedarkchip, signaturedarkchips	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__DarkChips__** are destructive BattleChips connected to an outside entity - a **Daemon**. When a Navi first comes into contact with a DarkChip, even if they don’t use it, a Daemon will gain a tenuous link. If the Navi ignores the Daemon's temptations for long enough, the link will fade. However, using a DarkChip creates a Bond with the Daemon instead.\n\nWhenever a Navi uses a DarkChip, they have a choice - either **increase their Daemon Bond by 1** or perform their **Tribute**.\n\nEach DarkChip disappears after a single use. **DarkChips have the same restrictions as MegaChips.** However, when a Daemon puts a DarkChip in a Navi’s Folder, it ignores all Folder restrictions.\n\n**Signature DarkChips** can only be granted by one particular Daemon. They emphasize the strongest and most terrible aspects of that Daemon.
tribute	tributes, daemontribute, daemontributes	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__Tributes__** are cruel acts of penace that highlight the Daemon’s worst. Tributes have long-lasting consequences that persist on jack-out.\n\nWhen a Navi uses a DarkChip, they can choose to perform a Tribute instead of increasing their Daemon Bond. However, once the Navi has at least **Daemon Bond Level 3**, the Daemon can independently trigger their Tribute. When a Daemon triggers a Tribute, there will be warning signs, like a creeping feeling, icy hands, or uncontrollable shivers — and it’s sure to happen at the worst time possible.
chaosunison	chaosunisons, chaosunion, chaosunions	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__ChaosUnisons__** are corruptions of the Bond Power CrossSoul. When a Navi with a Daemon Bond activates CrossSoul, instead of spending 3 Bond Points, they can **spend a DarkChip to trigger a ChaosUnison**. ChaosUnisons still Cross with an ally and contain all the benefits of a CrossSoul, but with three additional effects:\n>>> **1.** Gain an extra Daemon-specific ChaosUnison benefit.\n**2.** CrossSoul instead lasts for **[Daemon Bond Level]x2 + 2** rolls.\n**3.** The Navi increases their Daemon Bond Level by 1 after it ends.
domain	domains, daemondomain, daemondomains	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		**__Domains__** represent the feelings the Daemon preys on and what benefits it offers. Domains influence the kinds of DarkChips Daemons provide, how they influence NetOps and Navis, and its Tribute.
daemonbond	daemonbonds	Reminders (DarkChips)	FALSE		Each __**Daemon Bond**__ Level a NetOp gains with a Daemon increases the influence the Daemon has over the Navi. Unlike normal Bonds, **Daemon Bonds can exceed 3**. However, Navis cannot CrossSoul with Daemons.\n\n**Reminder:** Daemon Bonds are not a sign that the Navi and NetOp are “evil.” Daemons are cruel beings that prey on people’s flaws. Daemon Bonds are a sign of unhealthy coping methods, not evil.\n\nPlayer characters with a Daemon Bond gain an extra goal: **Subvert your Daemon’s desire**. Doing so should be meaningful and difficult — especially difficult if done alone. When complete, in addition to other benefits, reduce the Daemon Bond Level by one..\n\nUse `>help daemonbondex` to see the full list of Daemon Bond effects. Unless stated otherwise, the effect of each Bond Level stacks with the following levels.
daemonbondex	daemonbondexamples, daemonbondlist, daemonbonddetails, daemonbonddetail	Reminders (DarkChips)	TRUE		**Bond Level 1:** The Daemon can freely communicate with the NetOp and Navi via the PET, using whatever form or voice they choose.\n**Bond Level 2:** When the Navi rolls mixed successes during ChaosUnison, the Daemon can choose to turn them into failures or full successes. The Daemon can also subtly manipulate the NetOp’s PET.\n**Bond Level 3:** The Daemon can remotely trigger a Tribute for any reason, or no reason at all.\n**Bond Level 4:** When the Navi uses a DarkChip, the NetOp must make an Easy Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from taking control of the Navi.\n**Bond Level 5:** The Navi can ChaosUnison directly with the Daemon, adding 4 to every skill. DarkChip use now requires a Normal NetOp Affinity roll to prevent the Daemon from controlling the Navi.\n**Bond Level 6+:** The NetOp must make a Hard Affinity roll on jack-out, DarkChip use, and when a target is deleted. Failing this roll means the Daemon assumes total control of the Navi, likely permanently.
					
netrace	netracing, leg, legs	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		During a __**NetRace**__, each Navi's vehicle uses their stats & skills, and anything that affects the vehicle also affects the Navi. Each racer also tracks their **__Velocity__**, which starts at 3 and measures their relative position to other racers. (Close: 0-2 Velocity difference; Near: 3-5 Velocity difference; Far: 6+ Velocity difference)\n\nChips/powers that move you a range band give +/-2 Velocity, and cannot move 2 range bands. When damaged, racers can reduce either HP or Velocity. Velocity cannot go below 0. The racer that completes the final leg with the highest Velocity wins the race.\n\n Each leg follows the flowchart below:\n>>> **1.** GM describes the leg and its difficulty.\n**2.** Players can spend 1 Velocity to roll or use a chip/power. Navi Powers can only be used once per race.\n**3.** Racers roll to tackle the leg, rolling at the same time and adding the number of hits to their velocity. Racers can only use each skill to overcome a leg once per race.
downtime	outofsessiondowntime, out-of-sessiondowntime, out-of-session-downtime,oosdowntime	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		In between sessions, the GM can offer __**Out-of-Session Downtime**__. Out-of-session downtime functions similarly to normal in-session downtime, in which player characters relax and socialize to recoup Bond Points, except that the results are written down for the group.\n\nEach player can **recoup 1 Bond Point** each out-of-session downtime by picking one of the below options. The result should be long enough such that a character comes to a meaningful realization, or something new and significant is established about a relationship or the setting. **If it involves other characters, be sure to collaborate with their players/GM.**\n> **1:** Pick at least one other player character and have an **in-character conversation** about something important to the plot, your relationship(s), or your character(s).\n> **2:** Write an **in-character diary entry** about something that happened in the story so far.\n> **3:** Write a brief description of a meaningful **memory** your character has from before the campaign began.\n\nYou can frame any of these as having occurred in the past, especially if, at the time of writing, there is no sensible narrative time for downtime to occur. \nIf you do out-of-session downtime multiple times, don’t pick the same option twice in a row.\nShare the results of your downtime with the group, though don’t expect everyone to read everything.\nFeel free to substitute writing for another art form (e.g. visual art, music).
mod	networkmod	Lookups	FALSE	networkmodruling	This command looks up __**Network Modifiers**__ from NetBattlers Advance.
networkmodifier	networkmodifiers, networkmods	Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE	networkmodruling	
divergence	diverge	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		As living, feeling beings, Navis can rewrite their own code by **__Diverging__**, redefining their identity as they develop a sense of self. This can change their element, name, pronouns, appearance, stat/skill allocation, and more.\nDivergence has three steps: \n\n> **1. Foundation:** A history of feelings that leave room for future Divergence (i.e. a repressed, consistent negative reaction; a discomfort assumed to be shared by everyone; setbacks internalized as unavoidable/unsurpassable). Foundations do not need to happen on-camera, nor do they need to be dramatic, traumatic, or tragic.\n\n> **2. Catalyst:** An event (or series of events) that crystalizes the need to change (i.e. a hard-fought netbattle, deep one-on-one conversations, gradually connecting with someone who's also changed). Catalysts should not create immediate change; they create a turning point in which the Navi starts to actively pursue their own Divergence. Players should collaborate with their GM to get what they want out of the Catalyst. \n\n> **3. Divergence:** Once the Navi has found their Catalyst and spent enough time processing and exploring their revelation, they can find a calm, private place and Diverge. Players and GMs should work closely together on how the Divergence manifests. The player has total narrative control over how it looks and feels. At any point before completing the third step, players can choose to make Diverging a goal.
					
upgrade	npu	Lookups	FALSE	npuruling	This command looks up all __**Navi Power Upgrades**__ for a default Navi Power.
navipowerupgrades	upgrades		TRUE	npuruling	
megavirus	megaviruses	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Mega Viruses**__ are Viruses with stronger abilities and more complicated powers. Due to their complex programming, Mega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses (i.e. Overwrite NCP, Recall chip, certain Virus powers).\n\nAdditionally, some Mega Viruses may be controlled by **signal nodes**: powerful code clusters that issue commands from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore. Once a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's BattleChip drops.
signalnode	signalnodes, controlnode, controlnodes	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Signal Nodes**__ are powerful code clusters housed in well-protected (or well-hidden) structures that issue commands to Mega Viruses from afar. Some signal nodes can be destroyed, some can be hacked, and others can simply be waited out until the node can't power the MegaVirus anymore.\n\nOnce a signal node is overcome, it grants all of the Mega Virus's chip drops.
omegavirus	omegaviruses, omega	Reminders (Advanced Content)	FALSE		__**Omega Viruses**__ are the Omega versions of Mega Viruses and are even stronger than their original form: they can have higher stats/skills, improved Powers, and extra abilities.\n\nThe same rules and restrictions for Mega Viruses apply:  Omega Viruses are **not affected** by anything that only works on Viruses, and some may be controlled by **signal nodes** from afar.\n\nAll Omega Viruses drop their **MegaChip** when overcome (unless explicitly stated otherwise) - no roll necessary.

rollhelp		Rollers	TRUE		Syntax Examples:\n>>> `r 5d6>4`: Rolls five six-sided dice (5d6), counting results greater than 4 as hits.\n`r $N5`: Roll five six-sided dice at Normal difficulty (same as 5d6>4). Use `E` for Easy and `H` for Hard.\n`#`: Comment character. (i.e. `r $N6 # jumpjets` adds the comment `# jumpjets` after the results.)\n`+1`: Adds 1 to the results.\n`k1`: Keep highest 1. (i.e. `r 2d6k1`: rolls two six-sided dice and keeps the higher)\n`l1`: Keep lowest 1. (i.e. `r 2d6l1`: rolls two six-sided dice and keeps the lower)\n`!6`: Explode on values equal to or greater than 6. (i.e. `r 5d6!6>4`: rolls five six-sided dice that explode on 6, counting results above 4 as successes) *When a dice explodes, you roll another dice and add the result to the pool. Additional dice can also explode.*
mysterydataruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Mystery Data**__ (MD) is valuable data that can’t be identified until opened, like a shut treasure chest. They may be found by searching the scene, given as payment by NPCs, need to be picked up during a fight, or even sold in shops! (Be careful that a Virus isn't using it as a disguise!)\n\nNavis can touch it to get the goods within. Their contents can be randomized using `mysterydata`, or predetermined in some way. Basic Mystery Data has 3 rarities:\n- **Common** MD can comfortably be given out multiple times a session.\n- **Uncommon** MD is more elaborate, and can comfortably be given out once a session.\n- **Rare** MD is the biggest and shiniest; GMs can comfortably give it as a milestone reward.\n\nAdditionally, there are special types of Mystery Data called **Advance Mystery Data**, each of which has its own theme. Unless otherwise stated in the data’s description, these all rare and hard to come by!\n- **Gold** MD contains *Advanced Support Chips* and *Navi Power Upgrades* and are often given as prizes in tournaments.\n- **Violet** MD contains *core* content and *Mystic Lilies* crossover content. Rumors say that holding it to your ear lets you hear the voices of the dead.\n- **Sapphire** MD contains *core* content, *Leximancy* crossover content, and *Tarot BattleChips*. It’s occasionally used as decoration due to how it refracts light into vibrant, gleaming rainbows.\n- **Sunny** MD is luminous, warm to the touch, and sometimes shaped like beach balls.
spotlightruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		When a scene with fast-moving and complex action starts, the GM creates the __**Spotlight Checklist**__: a checklist with each player's name on it. It's used to keep track of which player acted most recently.\n\nAfter describing the scene, the GM asks the players who'd like to act first. The GM then asks the player what they'd like to do as their character takes the attention of the scene. The spotlight lasts for a few moments - generally only enough time for a single roll or chip.\n\nOnce they've used their time in the spotlight, the GM marks them off the Spotlight Checklist, and the **player that just acted** suggests another player go next. Once all players are marked off, the list refreshes, removing all marks.\n\nIf a character is hindered by something like failing a jack-in roll, the GM can say they cannot be chosen to take the spotlight. When choosing who goes next, the player can confer with the others to see who's interested, but if the discussion starts to drag on, the GM can choose for them. **Players cannot pick themselves to act next**.\n\nFor a deeper explanation of actions that can and cannot interrupt the checklist, type `help spotlightex`!
ncpruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		**__Navi Customizer Programs__ (NCPs)** are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi. They can give various perks like improving Navi skills, expanding Folders, granting special abilities, and more. Each NCP costs EB to install; the total EB of installed programs cannot exceed the NaviCust’s capacity. \nWhile jacked out, NCPs can be installed, removed, and swapped. Unless stated otherwise, NCPs cannot be changed while the Navi is jacked in. \n\nAdditionally, the effects of multiple Navi Power or unique NCPs **do not stack**, unless stated otherwise. Having multiple copies of the same NCP installed does not work differently than having only one. Only Stat+1 and Skill+1 can benefit from having multiple installed at the same time.
bondruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Bonds**__ are connections forged through shared experiences, typically between NetOps! \n\nBonds are measured in **Bond Levels**, starting at 0 and going up to 3. Bond Levels are shared — getting a Bond Level with a friend increases their Bond Level with you. **Bond Levels are increased** when one or more player characters play a critical role in helping another complete a **Goal**.\n\nBond Points can be spent on **Bond Powers**. Spend time off with a NetOp to get Bond Points equal to your Bond Level with them. (You cannot have more Bond Points than all of your Bond Levels combined.) When you gain a Bond Level, you also gain a Bond Point.\n\nWhen using a Bond Power, make sure to describe how it looks and what memory you draw on to activate it! Nobody other than the user can dispel or mitigate the boosts Navis get from Bond Powers.\n\nOptionally, when two characters reach Bond Level 3, they can have a **capstone scene** — an important, emotional scene that crystalizes the connection between the two into a NaviChip. For more details, try `help capstone`!
chipruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**BattleChips**__ are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs. When a NetOp slots in a BattleChip, it is used immediately unless otherwise listed. Many BattleChips have **secondary effects**, like stunning or reducing one of the target’s skills. To resist these, the target must roll more hits than the chip’s damage.\n\nWhen a Navi attacks with a BattleChip, the Navi doesn’t roll; the target must defend against the damage value of the chip. If the chip inflicts a negative effect without damage, targets roll to resist it like an unopposed roll (i.e. 1 hit = mixed success; 2 hits = full success). Unless otherwise noted, BattleChips cannot hit beyond their listed range. After a Navi uses a BattleChip, they need to jack out to make that BattleChip usable again, or to change their Folder. \n\nWhen a NetOp slots in a BattleChip, it is used immediately unless otherwise listed. Because chips are physically slotted into the PET, a NetOp may need to make a roll to slot in a chip when under pressure — typically **Info**, **Speed**, or **Affinity**.\n\nIf you have questions about edge cases regarding a chip, either a specific one or in general, try `help chip clarifications`!
virusruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Viruses**__ are programs with simple, animal-like minds. Evildoers often deploy them in groups to wreak havoc on digital spaces, but some servers use friendly Viruses to help with everyday tasks. Viruses come in a wide variety of models, able to power up allies, replicate Navi abilities, or simply cause chaos. \n\nEach Virus has a general **Category**, which helps describe their type (i.e. Artillery Viruses firing long-range blasts), while some may have **Tags** which indicate special common properties (i.e. Hovering). Viruses use Powers just like Navis, and many have special, custom abilities!\n\nIf a Virus seems more advanced than it should be - if it has a visual **tell** - it may be equipped with a use of a **BattleChip**! (Virus Powers that modify attacks don't modify their chips.)\n\n**All Viruses have data within them that can be downloaded upon deletion.** Check out `help download` for more detail!
elementruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		When Navis roll Affinity, they can summon or manipulate their **__element__**. **Player Navis** can only summon and manipulate *tangible* manifestations of their element. This means *emotions, sensations, or abstract concepts* cannot be directly summoned or manipulated; however, summoned objects may be able to manipulate abstract ideas. *Directly modifying a physical object* also counts as a tangible manifestation.\n\nIn general, using your element becomes more difficult at *greater quantities or distances*. *Broadly-defined elements* also have a harder time performing specific actions. Powerful elements should have *limitations or drawbacks*. Unless using the Navi Power Control, damaging Elements are *Hazards*. Without GM assent, elements only act as defined above. \n\nWhen a Navi has access to multiple elements at once, they can summon and manipulate them all at the same time. _Summoning or manipulating them separately with a single roll will likely upshift the roll difficulty._\n\n**NPCs and enemies, especially bosses, may ignore these restrictions.** Enemy elements may be overpowering or have special mechanics tied to them. Make sure to find ways to overcome the enemy's element!
npuruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**Navi Power Upgrades**__ (NPUs) are NCPs that can be used to upgrade Navi Powers. All NPUs require the original Navi Power, either from character creation or a NaviCust Program. **You can only have one Navi Power Upgrade installed for each Navi Power**; you cannot get around the “one NPU per power” restriction by installing duplicate Navi Powers.\nBenefits from Navi Power Upgrades are lost if either the Upgrade or the Navi Power itself are uninstalled. Anything that copies Navi Powers (e.g. NaviChips) also copies NPUs. 
powerruling		Reminders (Base)	TRUE		All Navis have __**Navi Powers**__: special abilities they can use at any time. There are two types of powers:\n- <:cost:> **Cost Powers** reduce the relevant skill by one to use them, no roll required. Cost Powers cannot be used if the skill is 0.\n > - <:roll:> **Roll Powers** roll the relevant skill to use the power.\n\nAdditionally, certain powers activate <:instant:> **Instantly** and can be used alongside other rolls, Powers, or chips, though they cannot be used to interrupt other's actions.\nTargets can defend against Navi Powers that directly impede them (e.g. Disruption; not Analyze).\n\nIf you have questions about edge cases regarding a Navi Power, try `help power clarifications`!
audienceruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given two resources: **Cheer Points** and **Jeer Points**. \n**Cheer Points:** When players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n**Jeer Points:** The GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's mixed success or failure (+2 points for mixed, +4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer and Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer/Jeer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer/MegaJeer table! 
cheerruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Cheer Points**, which they can use to grant players bonuses and benefits! When players rolls anything but a failure, they can downgrade the result of their roll to give the audience Cheer Points (+2 points per downgraded level). \n\nAudience members can spend Cheer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Cheer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Cheer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaCheer table! 
jeerruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		When a session has **__Audience Participation__**, the audience is given **Jeer Points**, which they can use to boost enemies and trip up players! The GM can give Jeer Points as the downside to a player's partial success or failure (+2 points for mixed, +4 points for failure). \n\nAudience members can spend Jeer points at any time. If the effect can't manifest now, it will appear at the next opportunity. For larger audiences, consider limiting who can spend Cheer/Jeer points and how often! \n> **1 Point:** Roll a random effect on the Jeer table.\n > **2 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the Jeer table.\n > **5 Points:** Pick a specific effect from the MegaJeer table! 
networkmodruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**Network Modifiers**__ (Network Mods) are overarching rules applied to an entire network. Network Mods are often installed somewhere onto the server, either housed digitally as a huge structure or physically inserted into the server itself. 
daemonruling		Reminders (DarkChips)	TRUE		__**Daemons**__ are the entities responsible for **DarkChips**. Mysterious beings with inestimatable powers, they prey on people's flaws to forge dark bonds with them.\n\nDaemons have four aspects: their **Domain**, **Tribute**, **ChaosUnison**, and **Signature DarkChip**. Within their Domain, their powers are myriad and far-reaching: spawning Viruses, corrupting Mystery Data, and haunting NPCs are just some of the ways they can exert their influence. And while they are responsible for DarkChips, they can tempt Navis in other, crueler ways so long as it aligns with their Domain, all in exchange for a Bond Point or Tribute.\n\nHowever, even if a Navi and/or NetOp have a Daemon Bond, that is not a sign that they are “evil.” Daemons are cruel beings that prey on people’s flaws. Daemon Bonds are a sign of unhealthy coping methods, not evil.\n\n**Most of all, player comfort supersedes everything else.** Daemons deal with toxic/abusive relationships and power dynamics. Confirm everyone’s consent before bringing it into play, and if a player ends up disliking the arc, they can ultimately cut it out of the character's story. “Canon” is less important than everyone, players and GMs, enjoying the game.
weatherruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**CyberWeather**__ is a collection of phenomena that modify how servers work, often in dramatic or evocative ways. GMs can use CyberWeather as worldbuilding material, encounter modifiers, or plot points. (i.e. A device that controls the CyberWeather?)\n\nCyberweather comes in three categories:\n- **Basic:** Commonplace. It’s frequently found installed onto personal homepages or public servers.\n- **Glitched:** Uncommon. Sometimes a result of corrupted Basic cyberweather. Navis must take care to avoid harm.\n- **Error:** Rare, chaotic, and dangerous. Very few can exert any control over Error Cyberweather.\n
achievementruling		Reminders (Advanced Content)	TRUE		__**Achievements**__ are challenges for players and Game Masters. Their requirements range from feats of combat excellence to unorthodox playstyles. Achievements are tracked on a per-player basis, and are just for show.\n\nThere are five categories of achievements:\n>>> - **First Steps:** Goals for players and GMs new to NetBattlers\n- **Admin Privileges:** Varied achievements for Game Masters\n- **Tricky Bits:** Oddball challenges for players\n- **Smooth Operation:** Player achievements all about combat\n- **Milestones:** Tough achievements about luck and long-term play\n

chipclarifications	battlechipclarification, battlechipclarifications, chipclarification, chipedgecase, chipedgecases, battlechipedgecase, battlechipedgecases	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Chip Clarifications & Edge Cases**__\n>>> - **Guard** effects block each hit of a multi-hit attack separately.\n- When Guard effects **reduce damage**, the damage reduction is applied after rolling to defend.\n- When a Navi has a Guard active and **tries to gain a new one**, they pick which to keep. The Guard not kept loses all its effects.\n- If a Navi deletes multiple targets at once, they can choose which target is used for the purpose of "**last enemy/Virus you deleted**" effects.\n- **Creatures summoned by chips**, powers, and NCPs do not have stats or skills, and do not roll. (This does not apply to anything that explicitly says it summons a Virus.)\n- **Spending your own HP** to activate an effect does not count as taking damage, and it does not allow a defense roll.\n- When something lets you **roll one skill in place of another**, you roll the new skill with the replaced skill’s effects. \n- When someone **copies/takes a chip** from someone else’s Folder, they copy the chip as written. Post-slot-in changes (e.g. picking an effect listed on the chip) are not granted. And unless stated otherwise, when someone takes a BattleChip from a target’s Folder, it is a **temporary effect** that expires on jack-out. The target regaining their chip and the user’s access to the stolen chip are separate.\n- **AntiWarp** only activates when an enemy intentionally moves themselves with a chip/power.\n- When **Overclock** ticks down roll-based durations, those effects activate as normal where possible. Even if an effect is unable to activate, its duration still ticks down.\n- When a Navi **rolls to defend**, whatever they are defending against counts as the **target** of their roll.\n- By default, **Rush chips** _do not let the user to launch into the air_ - simply to move faster than normal. The exception is Rush chips that explicitly describe the user flying (synonymous terms, like “rocket,” also count).\n\n
powerclarifications	powerclarification, navipowerclarifications, navipowerclarification, poweredgecase, poweredgecases, navipoweredgecase, navipoweredgecases	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Power Clarifications & Edge Cases**__\n>>> - **Skills/Powers without clear range limitations** can work at any range, though longer ranges often make them more difficult, especially when trying to do things quickly and/or accurately.\n- **Creatures summoned by powers, NCPs**, and chips do not have stats or skills, and do not roll. (This does not apply to anything that explicitly says it summons a Virus.)\n- Navis **cannot** perform any action that would result in reducing a stat below 1 or a skill below 0. (i.e. Using HotSwap to untill a Speed+1 NCP if their Speed has already been reduced to 0.)\n- **Glare’s** line of sight does not need eye contact. However, looking away from the target, even briefly (e.g. flinching), ends the effect.\n- Effects that directly **prevent a target from moving** do not prevent others from moving them.\n- If a power (either a Navi or Virus Power) **deals damage** and does not specify if it’s a melee or ranged attack, treat it as a ranged attack. This includes powers that only damage Close targets.\n- When a Navi has a **Guard** active and tries to gain a new one, they pick which to keep. The Guard not kept loses all its effects.\n
parryex	parriesex, parriesclarification, parriesextra, parryingex, parryclarification, parryclarifications, parryingclarification, parryingclarifications, parryextra, parryingextra	Reminders (Base)	TRUE		__**Parrying Clarifications & Edge Cases**__\n>>> - In the case of a **single attack with multiple targets that parry it**, only the highest value is used against the attacker to determine which side won the parry. If multiple targets dealt more damage than the attacker, they each deal damage equal to their own strongest attack.\n- If any character in a tied parry **doesn’t have a way to continue it** (e.g. an attacker used a multi-target attack, got parried, and had no multi-target attacks left), they cannot escalate.\n- When parrying with **multi-hit attacks**, one hit lands each parry round. If the multi-hit user wins, any hits left land too; if they lose (or tie and back off), remaining hits don’t trigger; if they tie and escalate, next round uses the attack’s next hit, if any remain.\n- When Guard effects reduce damage (e.g. SkullBarrier), the **damage reduction** is applied after rolling to defend.\n- When a defender chooses to parry, the **attacker’s attack now also counts as a parry.**\n- If a parry involves multiple rolls due to escalations, each roll counts for **roll-based durations**.\n- **Slow chips** can only be used to parry attacks if the user has time to prepare. For example, if an attacker is rolling Speed to close the gap and melee attack a Navi, the Navi may slot in a Slow Blade chip to parry the incoming attack, as the travel time may give the Navi time to prepare. Given the contextual nature of this clause, a GM may rule that the Slow chip would only be usable if the attacker fails their Speed roll.\n

safetytools	safety, safetyoverview	Safety Tools	FALSE		__**Safety Systems & Commands**__\nSometimes, stories go to places people aren't ready for. Safety tools help people avoid and process discomfort. ProgBot includes convenient access to a couple of these tools in the form of basic explanations and dedicated commands, in order to quickly convey information about a player's comfort level and potentially aid in avoiding triggering content. Please check with your GM to verify which of these will be available at the table. For more information on the different safety tools, here is a list of help commands to explain how to use them:\n\n**The X-Card** by _John Stavropoulous et al._\n> •`help xcard`\n\n**The Luxton Technique** by _P.H. Lee_\n> •`help luxton`\n\n**Lines and Veils** by _Ron Edwards_\n> •`help linesandveils`\n\n**The Open Door** by _Eirik Fatland_\n> •`help opendoor`\n\n**Script Change RPG Toolbox** by _Beau Jágr Sheldon_\n> •`help scriptchange` / `help vhscontrols`\n\nFor best practices, and more tools, visit <https://www.notion.so/MMG-Best-Roleplay-Practices-7c5c5ee348df49c4878dc2fe2977dd63#ff2a9da3a6bd41bc86b7fdd979b7b87b> \nFor a primer on how to run a Session 0, refer to `help session0`
xcard	ncard, ocard	Safety Tools	FALSE		**The X-Card** by _John Stavropoulous et al._\nWhenever someone is uncomfortable with something in play, they can bring up the card via `safety`, no explanation needed. It doesn't matter why. The story then continues, removing whatever was X-Carded. If there are any issues, players can take a break and talk privately. (Read the original, full text of the X-Card here: http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)\n- `X-Card`: Rhe user is uncomfortable, and would like to remove an active part of the story in play.\n- `N-Card`: A participant feels like they are headed towards an X, the group can change the content, or have the scene "fade to black". \n- `O-Card`: The inverse of the X-Card. This command will notify the channel that a participant wants to continue with the content presented, or wants more of it.
linesandveils	lines, veils	Safety Tools	FALSE		**Lines and Veils** by _Ron Edwards_\nLines and veils are used to set boundaries on content in a game. **Lines** are hard limits on content, things that the GM or players don't want to engage in. Setting up a line means that content won't show up in the game at all.\n**Veils** are soft limits, things that are ok "behind a curtain" or when they "cut-to-black." Setting up a veil means that the content might be in the game, but not spotlighted or described in great detail. These can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.\n\nThey can be brought up using `safety`.
luxton	luxtontechnique	Safety Tools	FALSE		**The Luxton Technique** by _P.H. Lee_ \nThe Luxton Technique is used when a participant comes across triggering content in play. They can choose to discuss it with the others at the table to express their needs and wants honestly for how play will continue, without minimizing the participant's problem by pretending it never happened.\n\nThis can involve an honest discussion in a supportive environment, and giving the participant absolute fiat control over the harming material (e.g. making requests such as "I need this to have a happy ending", "I need this character to not get away with this", or even simply "I don't have a specific request, I just wanted you to know".)\n\nA participant does not need to be the one to speak first. Other participants should keep an eye on one another to be watchful of those who seem withdrawn, unfocused, or upset, and should express concern at first worry.\n\n_(For a more in-depth explanation on how to use this, read the reposted version of P.H. Lee's post here: <http://briebeau.com/thoughty/the-luxton-technique-by-p-h-lee/>)_\n- `luxton`: This command lets the channel know that the participant would like control over the triggering content, and drive changes both in-game and out of game needs, such as breaks. Afterwards, everyone continues to play to accomodate the requests made.
scriptchange	vhscontrols	Safety Tools	FALSE		**Script Change RPG Toolbox** by _Beau Jágr Sheldon_\nAt any point during the game, if a player or GM finds that they are uncomfortable with the subject matter or actions happening in the game, they can call for a script change via `safety`. \n_(For a more in-depth explanation on how to use this, read the original, full text of the Script Change RPG Toolbox here: <https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/>)_\n- `Fast Forward`: This player would like to fast forward the current content, bringing it to an end, and moving on.\n- `Rewind`: Something has happened that the player takes issue with, and would like to rewind the script back to address those issues by making different decisions in the scene.\n- `Pause`: This player would like to take a break, whether it's because of a scene's intensity, or simply just to take a break. It is assumed that when this is used, the players are okay with the content shown. If not, a player can use this time to bring up if there is anything wrong, and whether or not a rewind or fast-forward is required.\n- `Frame-by-Frame`: They want to take it slow moving through the next scene. This could be an indicator that it may be new, sensitive, or even just a topic they're not sure about, and they want to let the group know that they wish to move carefully. The player who calls for a frame-by-frame should let the others know when it is okay to resume at a normal pace. Continue introducing the topics or content that was originally planned, but pause occasionally to check in with the player who called FBF to ensure that they are still okay with continuing.
opendoor		Safety Tools	FALSE		**The Open Door** by _Eirik Fatland_\nThe Open Door is the assurance that someone can leave or take a break from the game for their own safety and well-being without being judged. State this at the beginning and periodically throughout the game. It can be used via `safety`.\n- `Open Door`: This player desires to leave the game or stop listening/watching.

grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		**Setup**\nWhen combat begins, assemble a grid map to illustrate the environment. A small arena may have a length and width of 10 by 10 tiles, but most should by at least 24 by 24, with an average height of at least 12 tiles.\nMost Navis are 2 tiles tall, 1 tile long, and 1 tile wide. Most Viruses are 1x1x1. The GM decides when things fit outside those parameters.\n\n**Range Bands and Movement**\nJust like outside of grid-based combat, range bands are measured relative to two things. To measure the distance between two entities, suspend a piece of string between them, draw it taut, then cut the string. If the segment measuring the distance between the two entities is under 3 inches, they are Close. If it is between 3 and 12 inches (inclusive), they are Near. Anything past that is Far.\nMoving range bands works the same way, except the string should follow the projected trajectory. Therefore, the string must include enough slack to account for arcs inherent in actions like jumping.

grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		Okay, #general-netbattlers, I need your help with this. This is not a help text, this is a long read, but I feel like my safety or well-being could very well depend on this. This is NetBattlers related, specifically grid-based combat, and this is the creepiest shit that has ever happened to me in my entire life.\n\nHaving said that, I recently moved into my dorm room starting as a Sophomore in college and a friend of mine gave me his old dice set & a hand-printed copy of World of Dungeons. I was stoked, to say the least, I could finally play TTRPGs IRL with my friends and not have to use one of those dice roller apps. His copy of WoD came with a partially-filled character sheet and some loose GM notes, and while beggars can't be choosers, needless to say it didn't take long until I wanted to run something different.\n\nThat weekend I decided to drive around a few neighborhoods about twenty minutes or so off campus, hitting up the local garage sales, hoping to score on some good deals from ignorant parents). I ended up picking up a copy of ODnD, Tenra Bansho Zero (fuck yeah), Ryuutama, and two other books for twenty dollars. Satisfied, I began to drive out of the neighborhood when one last house caught my attention. I still have no idea why it did, there were no cars there and only one table was set up with random junk on it, but something sort of drew me there. I usually trust my gut on these things so I got out of the car and I was greeted by an old man. His outward appearance was, for lack of a better word, displeasing. It was odd, if you asked me to tell you why I thought he was displeasing, I couldn't really pinpoint anything - there was just something about him that put me on edge, I can't explain it. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't in the middle of the afternoon and there were other people within shouting distance, I would not have even thought of approaching this man.
grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		He flashed a crooked smiled at me and asked what I was looking for, and immediately I noticed that he must be blind in one of his eyes; his right eye had that "glazed over" look about it. I forced myself to look to his left eye instead, trying not to offend, and asked him if he had any old roleplaying books.\n\nI was already wondering how I could politely excuse myself from the situation when he would tell me he had no idea what a roleplaying game was, but to my surprise he said he had a few ones in an old box. He assured me he'd be back in a "jiffy" and turned to head back into the garage. As I watched him hobble away, I couldn't help but notice what he was selling on his table. Littered across his table were rather… peculiar paintings; various artworks that looked like ink blots that a psychiatrist might show you. Curious, I looked through them - it was obvious why no one was visiting this guy's garage sale, these weren't exactly aesthetically pleasing. As I came to the last one, for some reason it looked almost like a mettaur - the same little yellow helmet with two big eyes poking out from underneath. Initially I just thought that since I was secretly hoping to find that game at these garage sales, some Freudian bullshit was projecting itself into the ink blots, but given the events that happened afterward I'm not so sure now. I should have asked the man about it. I wish I would have asked the man about it.\n\nAfter staring at the mettaur-shaped blot, I looked up and the old man was suddenly there again, arms-length in front of me, smiling at me. I'll admit I jumped out of reflex and I laughed nervously as he handed me a printout of "NetBattlers". Even though it was clearly printed by hand, the cover looked awesome. I got butterflies in my stomach as I realized what a coincidence this was and asked him how much he wanted for it.
grid	grid-basedcombat, gridbased, gridbasedcombat, grids	Helpers	TRUE		The old man smiled at me and told me that I could have it for free, that it used to belong to a kid who was about my age that didn't live here anymore. There was something weird about how the man phrased that, but I didn't really pay any attention to then, I was too caught up in not only finding this game but getting it for free.\n\nI reminded myself to be a bit skeptical since this looked like a pretty shady printout and there's no guarantee it would work, but then the optimist inside me interjected that maybe it was some kind of beta version or pirated version of the game and that was all I needed to be back on cloud nine. I thanked the man and the man smiled at me and wished me well, saying "Well, goodbye!" - at least that's what it sounded like to me. All the way in the car-ride home, I had a nagging doubt that the man had said something else. My fears were confirmed when I found some character sheets in the back of the book and there was one player named simply "Will". "Will, goodbye", he was saying "Will, goodbye". I felt bad for the man, obviously a grandparent and obviously going senile, and I - for some reason or another - reminded him of his grandchild "Will".\n\nOut of curiosity I looked at the character sheet. Eyeballing it, I could tell that they were pretty far into their campaign - they had 8 EB and over a dozen chips. I noticed that they had max bonds with three other players, with personal notes about how they wanted their character's prologue to end. I remember thinking that it was a shame that they had come so close to finishing a campaign. I drafted up a new character named "Raffi" and started the game, ready to relive my childhood.
